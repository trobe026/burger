# Eat-Da-Burger

This is a Full-Stack Web App built using Express Handlebars and MySQL.  The app allows users to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat, which will then appear in a pane on the left side.  

The user can then choose to **Devour** or **Delete** the burger.  

If they choose to devour it, the burger will move to a right-side pane, where they user can delete it, or **Regurgitate** it to move it back to the left-side pane.

All burgers are saved to a MySQL database.  The app is also deployed on Heroku using JawsDB.
